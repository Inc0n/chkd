* chkd
This is an unfinished project written in nimlang that was created to implement some of the features, that shkd did not have.

* How this works 

** C part
Because nim doesn't have a library that provide API to some of the Mac OS interface.
A library is written in c that will provide the API for the nim part to call.

** Nim part 
The configuration file parsing and evaluation/execution is written in Nim

The syntax look like this:
#+begin_src conf 
set $test ctrl
# reload

bind cmd+a:            exec echo epple
bind cmd+e:            exec echo apple
#+end_src
